# Topological Divergences for Time Series

Research code exploring merge tree divergence features for ML on chaos detection and quantification.

## Code quality

NB: code is very experimental and disorganised, please be aware and use with care.

## Results and figures

Topological divergence data relevant to the corresponding thesis can be found in the `outputs/data/` and the `outputs/figures/` directories.
